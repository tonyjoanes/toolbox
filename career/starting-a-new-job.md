# Starting a new company

Things that I find useful when starting a new company and things I want to do
when I start the next company.

## Pair Program 👩‍💻

From the beginning get some pair programming in. This will show you the flow that is being used
at the company and what the developers are like. Discover any challenges when programming on the new codebase
and what obstacles there are.

### Go Solo 👦

Pickup your own change. Try it for *1hr* and see how you get on with it. Ask for help after the 1hr mark
even if you think you can complete it. Then finish it off together with another developer.

## Domain 💡

Learn about the domain and what problem you're solving. Who else solves this problem and how do they do it
, with what technologies etc

## Question Everything ❔

Ask lots of questions, get answers and document the answers. You will learn a lot from doing this and it also
challenges the new team and you can see how much they know.

If you have something in a meeting that you think hasn't been understood you can ask the audience
and get someone who didn't initially describe the problem to summarise it back to you. This shows
whether everyone else understood the item.

## Document 📃

If common actions that you are asked to do are not documented then do this so that next time you have
a set of instructions how to do the task. It also means this task can be handed over to someone
else which is more scalable than keeping it in your head.

### Consistent Notes 📒

Use a consistent note taking tool and ideally use the company shared wiki tool so that you can get your notes
validated and they will also be useful to other people in the future.

### Get upto speed 🚤

Use the source control tool.

Look for code that is continuously being changed. This could be a bug hive, lots of bugs that need fixing all the time. Or the code could be really coupled.
