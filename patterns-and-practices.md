# Patterns and Practices

Here you will find links and examples of best practices and patterns that can help us develop great sofware and architectures.  

## Ports and Adapters

A basic code example [Ports and Adapters](https://github.com/tonyjoanes/ports-and-adapters). Also read about Hexagonal Architectures and how we can have swappable data sources and not
couple our domains to any particular implementation. [Hexagonal Architecture](https://netflixtechblog.com/ready-for-changes-with-hexagonal-architecture-b315ec967749)

An explanation by Kennth Lange [Ports and Adapters](https://www.kennethlange.com/ports-and-adapters/)

This includes ports and adapters but also puts the whole thing together describing each layer of the onion so to speak.
