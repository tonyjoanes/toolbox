# Ideas 💡

A collection of ideas that I have had or experienced that I like and would implement as an Engineering Manager.

## Team Sharing 🤝

Its nice to have a weekly meeting of sharing what was achieved, this can be quick informal meeting
with screenshots and memes to share the concept

Express kudos in these meetings too.... have fun with the meeting. 🎁

## Team Guilds / Syncs

Get the leads or people that want to be part of a guild to meet regularly and tackle common issues and 
share ideas and improvements that can add value to teams

## OKR Reviews

Actually make them all visible and have owners of those so you can track the progress of them. There are some tools that can help you do this and be able to visualise the progess of the OKR's.

You could use a tool and/or capture progess as % complete and confidence to score the OKR. There is probably some good resource to read up on this and how to measure them.
