# Dora Metrics

DORA metrics are used by DevOps teams to measure their performance and find out whether they are “low performers” to “elite performers”. The four metrics used are deployment frequency (DF), lead time for changes (LT), mean time to recovery (MTTR), and change failure rate (CFR).

**Deployment Frequency:** Refers to the frequency of successful software releases to production.

**Lead Time for Changes:** Captures the time between a code change commit and its deployable state.

**Mean Time to Recovery:** Measures the time between an interruption due to deployment or system failure and full recovery.

**Change Failure Rate:** Indicates how often a team’s changes or hotfixes lead to failures after the code has been deployed.
