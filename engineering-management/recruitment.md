# Interviews

My thoughts on interviewing for candidates

## Format

Come up with a standard format to the interviews which you can use for each candidate for consistency

- Introductions üë¨
  - A little about the company
  - A little about the role and what you're looking for
- Briefly explain the interview process
- Technical questions based from their experience
- Time for their questions at the end ‚ùî
  - Really important to see what they come up with
  - Have their research the role/company
  - Have they come up with questions during the interview

## Basic Rules

- Turn off all notifications
- Update your communication tool (Teams/Slack etc) status to **Interviewing**
- Remove distractions if interviewing remotely, keep backgrounds clean and simple
- Dont ask about things that could be conceived as unconcious bias
  - Where are you from?
  - Do you have kids?
  - What year did you graduate?

## Scoring

It is useful to have more than one person on the interview as you will need to take notes!
Create a score card which can be used to assess the candidates afterwards, its easy to forget stuff.

Decide on the roles at the beginning, one person could be a time keep and ensure the format is followed
