## Context switching

Everytime you have a meeting and then go back to working there is a time cost of context switching back into where you were before the meeting. Remember this and make decisions on whether the meeting is really necessary and if another method can be utilised.

## Agenda

Descscribe  what a metting is about, it should have an agenda

*If there is nonot an Agenda then ask the organiser for one*

## Record

Useful to record meetings so that people can watch them back in their own time and perhaps even on faster speeds to get through the information

## Outcomes

What decision is being made in the meeting. The reason for having a meeting is typically for a decision to be made to make this explicit and clear on what decisions are being made.
This might be assigning work to someone, chosing a method or an approach

## Is the meeting necessary?

Sometimes just an async discussion can be had to figure out what needs to be done.
