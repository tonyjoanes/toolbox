## Azure

### SKU

Basically a Stock Keeping Unit and are the different types of units you can buy (pay for) in Azure.

As an example

> Azure Load Balancer has 3 SKUs - Basic, Standard, and Gateway. Each SKU is catered towards a specific scenario and has differences in scale, features, and pricing.
